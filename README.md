> Attention extension authors! The Azure Account extension is being replaced by [VS Code's built-in Microsoft authentication extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/extensions/microsoft-authentication). We've built a [wrapper SDK for Azure authentication npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/vscode-azext-azureauth). If you are creating a new extension that needs authentication to Azure, please use this instead of the Azure Account extension.

The Azure Account extension provides a single Azure sign in and subscription filtering experience for all other Azure extensions. It makes Azure's Cloud Shell service available in VS Code's integrated terminal.

## Signing In/Out

There are multiple commands accessible via the [command palette](https://aka.ms/AAephuz) that may be used to sign into Azure.

Sign out of Azure using the `Azure: Sign Out` command.

## Azure Cloud Shell

Azure Cloud Shell instances can be started via the terminal view in VS Code. To begin, click the
dropdown arrow in the terminal view and select from either `Azure Cloud Shell (Bash)` or
`Azure Cloud Shell (PowerShell)`.

If this is your first time using the Cloud Shell, the following notification will appear prompting
you to set it up.

The Cloud Shell will load in the terminal view once you've finished configuring it.

You may also upload to the Cloud Shell using the `Azure: Upload to Cloud Shell` command.
